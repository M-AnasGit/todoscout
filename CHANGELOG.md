## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 72ba9e1: ## Summary

  This update resolves an issue with the CLI execution of `todoscout`, ensuring that the `dist/index.js` file correctly exports the necessary functions and that `bin/index.js` properly invokes them. The CLI tool is now fully functional and can be used as expected.

  ***

  ## Changes Implemented

  ### 1. **Fixed CLI Entry Point**

  - The `src/index.ts` file now properly exports the main logic, allowing the CLI to execute commands correctly.
  - The `bin/index.js` file correctly references and runs the CLI logic.

  ### 2. **Ensured Proper Build Configuration**

  - Adjusted the build settings to generate the correct output format.

  ***

  ## Outcome

  - The CLI now runs without errors and properly executes commands.
  - Users can install and use the package as intended.

  - **Metadata extraction**: Supports extracting metadata like `@user(john)`, `@due(2024-05-01)`, and `@status(pending)`.
  - **Customizable patterns**: Users can define their own task keywords and metadata formats in `.whatodorc.json`.
  - **Recursive scanning**: Searches all project files while ignoring specified directories (e.g., `node_modules`, `dist`).
  - **Structured report generation**: Outputs a clear, formatted summary of all detected tasks.
  - **CLI commands**:
    - `whatodo init` â†’ Initializes a configuration file.
    - `whatodo scan` â†’ Scans the project and generates a report.

  This marks the first stable release of **whatodo**, making it easier to track unfinished tasks directly from the command line! ðŸš€
